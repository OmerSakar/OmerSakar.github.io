	In my free time I like to do the following (in no particular order); Tinkering with hardware and software. Amateur server maintainer. Reading on history, religion, ethics and Computer Science related pieces in general (either Dutch, Turkish or English). Amateur woodworker. Nostalgic gamer. Logic puzzles such as sudokus, nonograms (also called Japanese crosswords or Japanese picture puzzles) and futoshikis and cube puzzles such as the Rubik's cube. Researching things I do not understand (yet). Learning in general. Teaching others to spread knowledge.
