# Work Experience

###### {{< fs txt="Formal methods and tools group, University of Twente, Enschede, Netherlands" size="16px">}}  

I am currently doing my PhD in the Formal Methods and Tools group, part of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science". The project I am involved with is called ChEOPS.

[ChEOPS](https://cheops.win.tue.nl/people) project: Integrating Verification into GPU Program Development. Within this project we investigate how to make the development and maintenance of software aimed at graphics processing units (GPUs) more insightful and effective in terms of functional correctness and performance.

GPUs have an increasingly big impact on industry and academia, due to their great computational capabilities. However, in practice, one usually needs to have expert knowledge on GPU architectures to optimally gain advantage of those capabilities. 

Within the project, I focussed on the verification of GPU code and the structured optimisation of GPU code, while ensuring that functional correctness is preserved. 

During my PhD, I worked mainly with the [VerCors](https://vercors.ewi.utwente.nl/) toolset, a deductive verifier for concurrent software. It also supports the deductive verification of GPGPU programs. For my publications, see [here](/publications).

Education I was involved in:
* **Programming**, Bachelor course, introduction to programming, role Teacher  
* **Programming Principles, Patterns, Processes**, Master's course, role assisting Teacher.
